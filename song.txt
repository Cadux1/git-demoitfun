You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

<<<<<<< HEAD
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
-------------------------------------------
=======
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
