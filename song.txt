You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart

Wahala go dey to ba lo
Plenty wahala go dey to ba lo
You dey make me dey wait for your love
Go on my knees and I pray to the Lord
After all, you have taken it all
Everything I've got, you have taken it all
Baby I've been there for so long
Now you say you don't want this no more
